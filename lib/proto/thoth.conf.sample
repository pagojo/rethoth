# Settings for live mode.
live:

  # Connection URI for the database. Currently SQLite3 and MySQL are supported.
  # PostgreSQL may work, but hasn't been tested.
  #
  # Sample SQLite3 config:
  #   db: sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database.db
  #
  # Sample MySQL config:
  #   db: mysql2://user:pass@hostname/database

  # General site settings.
  site:
    # Name of your blog. This will be displayed as the title of your blog's
    # index page and in your blog's feeds.
    name: New Thoth Blog

    # A brief description or subtitle for your blog.
    desc: Thoth is awesome.

    # Base URL of your site. This is necessary in order for Thoth to know how
    # to construct links. Be sure to set this correctly or links may not work.
    url: http://localhost:7000/

    # URLs of CSS files to load in addition to the default Thoth CSS. You can
    # override Thoth's default styles by specifying your own CSS files here.
    # These can be relative or absolute URLs.
    #
    # Example:
    #   css:
    #     - /css/foo.css
    #     - 'http://example.com/bar.css'
    #
    css: []

    # URLs of JS files to load in addition to the default Thoth JS. You can

    # JS files here. These can be relative or absolute URLs.
    #
    # Example:
    #   js:
    #     - /js/foo.js
    #     - 'http://example.com/bar.js'
    #
    js: []

    # Whether or not to allow visitors to post comments in response to blog
    # posts.
    enable_comments: true

    # Whether or not you want to expose a sitemap for your blog. A sitemap is
    # an XML file that gives search engines information about all the URLs on
    # your site so they can index them more easily.
    #
    # If enabled, you'll be able to see your sitemap at
    # http://yourdomain.com/sitemap and you can submit this URL to search
    # engines to improve the indexing of your site (and possibly your pagerank).
    enable_sitemap: true

    # Gravatar settings.
    gravatar:
      # Whether or not to enable Gravatar images on comments. Gravatar is a free
      # service that allows people to associate profile images with an email
      # address so that their postings on blogs and other websites are easily
      # identifiable. Learn more at http://www.gravatar.com/.
      enabled: true

      # Default icon set to use for users who don't have custom Gravatars. See
      # gravatar.com for the latest options. As of this writing, the available
      # choices are "identicon" (geometric shapes), "monsterids" (cutesy little
      # monsters), and "wavatars" (cutesy geometric shapes).
      #
      # Alternatively, you can specify the URL of your own custom image here and
      # that image will be used instead.
      default: identicon

      # Maximum Gravatar rating to allow. Available ratings are "g", "pg", "r",

    name: John Doe

    # Your email address. If you leave this blank or comment it out, it won't be
    # displayed.

    # Administrator username. This is the name you'll use to log into Thoth.

  # Plugins that should be loaded when Thoth starts. Usually it's not
  # necessary to load a plugin until the first time it's used, but some plugins
  # alter core functionality and thus must be loaded at start time.
  #
  # Example:
  #   plugins:
  #     - foo
  #     - bar
  #     - baz
  #
  plugins: []

  # Absolute path to a directory where uploaded media files (images, videos,
  # etc.) for your blog posts and pages should be stored. This directory needs
  # to be readable and writeable by the user running the Thoth server.
  media: <%= Thoth::HOME_DIR %>/media

  # Server settings.
  server:
    # Server adapter to use. This can be any adapter Ramaze supports.
    adapter: webrick

    # IP address on which Thoth should listen for connections. Specify 0.0.0.0
    # if you want Thoth to listen on all addresses.
    address: 0.0.0.0

    # Port on which the Thoth server should listen for connections.
    port: 7000

    # Whether or not to enable caching. Enabling caching will significantly
    # improve Thoth's performance under heavy traffic.
    enable_cache: true

    # Whether or not to enable automatic, on the fly minification of your blog's
    # external CSS and JavaScript files. Enabling minification will reduce
    # page weight and is a great way to improve performance, but you'll need to
    # restart Thoth in order for CSS and JS changes to take effect.
    #
    # Note: this setting will have no effect if you're running Thoth under
    # Phusion Passenger or any other environment in which static file requests
    # are handled by a frontend server without passing through Ramaze.
    enable_minify: true

    # Filename to which errors should be logged when running in production mode,
    # or blank if you don't care about errors.
    error_log: <%= Thoth::HOME_DIR %>/log/error.log

    # Memcache settings.
    memcache:
      # Whether or not to enable memcache. When enabled along with the
      # server.enable_cache setting above, Thoth will use memcache for all cache
      # operations instead of the default per-process Hash-based cache.
      #
      # This may be beneficial if you have a very high-traffic blog and
      # distribute load across multiple Ramaze processes or physical servers,
      # but in most cases it's overkill.
      #
      # Note: This option requires that the memcache-client gem be installed.
      enabled: false

      # Memcache servers to use. Each entry in this list must contain at least
      # a hostname, and optionally a port number and priority.
      #
      # Example:
      #   servers:
      #     - 'localhost:11211:1'
      #     - 'foo.example.com:11211:2'
