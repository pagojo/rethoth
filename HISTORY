Thoth History
================================================================================
Version 0.4.0.dev (2017.03.13)
  * Welcome to 2017!
  * Requires Ruby 2.3.0
  * Requires Ramaze 2012.12.08
  * Requires Innate 2015.10.28
  * Requires Sequel 4.42.0
  * Forked on January 9th 2017. 
  * It seems that the code forked was last updated on 2012/11/28.
  * Updated a lot of code to bring it to 2017 (see changelog).
  * Added John Pagonis to the copyright messages.
  * Thank you Ryan Grove for Thoth :-)
   
Version 0.3.0 (?)
  * Requires Ramaze 2010.06.18.
  * Requires Sequel 3.8.x.
  * Thoth can now be run under Phusion Passenger (mod_rack/mod_rails) or any
    other server that supports Rackup specifications. This is now the preferred
    way to run Thoth. [Thanks to Steven Bedrick]
  * Significant caching and performance optimizations.
  * Blog posts can now be saved as drafts, so you can save posts in progress
    without publishing them.
  * Added Gravatar support, enabled by default. Set site.gravatar.enabled to
    false if you don't want it.
  * Added site.css and site.js config arrays, which allow you to specify CSS
    and JS URLs that should be loaded in addition to the default Thoth CSS and
    JS. This way you don't have to override the CSS and JS templates to
    customize your theme.
  * Added memcache support, disabled by default. Overkill for most blogs, but if
    you've got a crazy high-traffic site and need to balance load across many
    processes or servers, this is for you.
  * Twitter plugin now excludes replies by default.
  * Twitter plugin now turns #hashtags into links.
  * Comments can now be enabled and disabled on individual posts.
  * Deleted comments remain in the database but are hidden from view, rather
    than being permanently deleted.
  * Comment HTML sanitization was separated out into a new gem, Sanitize.
  * The "New comment" form now requires an email address.
  * Comment titles are now limited to 150 characters instead of 255.
  * Long unbroken runs of text without whitespace in comments are now broken up
    with <wbr /> tags to make them wrap without breaking the site layout.
  * Fixed a bug that caused an invalid path to be used for media files uploaded
    via Internet Explorer.
  * Added a Pinboard plugin.

Version 0.2.1 (2008-09-09)
  * Requires Sequel 2.5.x (this fixes an issue with SQLite and DateTime
    objects).
  * Requires RedCloth 4.0.x. Markdown syntax is no longer supported as a result.
  * Names of existing tags are now suggested as you type in the "Tags" field
    when creating or editing a blog post.
  * Blog post URL names can now be specified just like pages, and names are
    automatically validated and checked for uniqueness via Ajax. If you don't
    manually enter a name, one will be created automatically based on the title.
  * Comments are now deleted via Ajax when JavaScript is enabled, making it
    easier to delete multiple comments without having to reload the page.
  * A rel="nofollow" attribute is now automatically added to links in user
    comments.
  * When minification is enabled, filenames in the public /css and /js
    directories that have names ending in "-min.css" or "-min.js" will be
    served as is since they are presumably already minified.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented client-side caching of CSS and JS when
    server-side caching and minification were enabled.
  * Fixed internal server error when viewing a tag that isn't attached to any
    posts.

Version 0.2.0 (2008-06-15)
  * Requires Ramaze 2008.06.
  * Requires Sequel 2.0.1.
  * Added --adapter command line option and server.adapter config option to
    specify a different Ramaze server adapter to use (the default is Thin).
  * Added --migrate command line option to automatically upgrade or downgrade
    a Thoth database schema.
  * Added site.enable_comments setting. Set this to false if you don't want
    users to be able to post comments on your blog.
  * Added server.enable_minify setting. When enabled, all CSS under /css and all
    JavaScript under /js will be minified on the fly.
  * Pagination bars now include links to up to nine nearby result pages in
    addition to the prev/next links.
  * Views are compiled by default in production mode, which improves performance
    significantly. To disable view compilation, set server.compile_views to
    false.
  * All admin forms validate a session-specific form token on submission to
    prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
  * The Flickr and Delicious plugins are now included in the main Thoth gem.
  * The Flickr and Delicious plugins have been modified to take advantage of
    Ramaze's improved value cache rather than handling their own caching.
  * Added a Twitter plugin.
  * Added a Tags plugin for displaying tag statistics.
  * Fixed incorrect default paths for the theme.public, theme.view, and media
    config settings.
  * Fixed the --home command line option.

Version 0.1.4 (2008-04-15)
  * Fixed a nasty bug introduced in 0.1.3 that caused a memory leak and resulted
    in the index page (/) not being cached properly.

Version 0.1.3 (2008-04-13)
  * When creating or editing a blog post or page, the preview is displayed above
    the edit form rather than below it.
  * Spaces in blog post URLs are replaced with - rather than _ (this change will
    only affect new posts; existing post URLs will not be changed).
  * Blog posts provide Atom feeds for recent comments.
  * Tag pages provide Atom feeds for posts with that tag.
  * Blog posts are marked up using the hAtom microformat.
  * Thoth auto-generates an XML sitemap at http://yourblog.com/sitemap (set
    site.enable_sitemap to false to disable).
  * Comment URLs are built using the name of the post the comment is attached to
    rather than the id.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented Atom and RSS feeds from being cached when
    server-side caching was enabled.
  * Fixed entry titles in Atom feeds claiming to be type="html" when in fact
    they weren't.
  * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused flash messages to be cached with the
    output of an action and re-displayed until the cached action expired.

Version 0.1.2 (2008-03-22)
  * Added MinifyController to minify JavaScript and CSS on the fly.
  * Bumped Ramaze dependency to 0.3.9.1 to chase some important bug fixes.

Version 0.1.1 (2008-03-17)
  * First release.
